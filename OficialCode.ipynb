The for mation provides eight \\nplayers behind the ball when defending and four playe rs ready to support the two forwards when \\nattacking. The two wide midfielders are used as wing ers, providing automatic width to the midfield \\nshape. The use of four defenders adds more compactne ss and balance in the back. Either the \\nsweeper or the flat back four system can be utilized.  \\n \\n \\n \\nRole of the Four Defenders  \\n \\nThe back four defenders must play as one unit around t he entire defensive half of the field.  \\nMost often teams will use one central defender (stop per) as a man for man marker and the \\nsecond as a sweeper or covering defender. Some teams o pt for a ‘\"flat back four\" with both \\ncentral defenders sharing the responsibility of markin g.  \\n \\nThis system is often preferred with the \"offside tra p\" tactics. The advantage of a 4-4-2 system is \\nthat it also allows more freedom for the two wide d efenders to attack. \\n  \\n  Role of the Two Wide Defenders  \\n  \\n• Must play as one unit around the entire defensive h alf of the field.  \\n• Maintain compactness to support each other and avoid  being spread out.   \\n• Must play as one unit up and down the wide channel w ith the midfield and wide forward.

The wide midfielder must act a s a fifth defender when the opponents are \\nattacking on the opposite side of the field. He shou ld occupy the space in the fullback position \\nand add cover whenever possible. The two central midf ielders should look to keep their position \\nin the middle of the field. \\n  \\n  Role of the Two Wide Midfielders  \\n  \\n• Must play as one unit across the middle of the field  with the two central midfielders.   \\n• Must play as one unit up and down the field with th e wide defender and wide forward.   \\n• Must act as a fifth defender when the opponents are attacking on the oppo site side of the \\nfield, occupying the space in the fullback position and  add cover whenever possible.   \\n• Get into advance positions of the ball whenever the ir team can play forward.   \\n• Look for blind-sided runs behind the defender when their team is attacking on \\nthe opposite side of the field.   \\n• Deliver early crosses to forwards.   \\nDeliver a variety of crosses into the far and near p ost.

The same one occurs in central positions, the pl ayer on the ball also has the possibility of \\nusing the overlapping run as a \"dummy\" and goes in t he opposite direction.  \\n \\nOne Touch Play.  \\n \\nOne touch play is an extremely important attacking tact ic as the opposition cannot pressurize you \\nif this occurs. If one touch play is to be effective the n an excellent understanding of support on \\nand off the ball is needed. Defenders react to movem ent of players and quick one touch play \\nwhich obviously requires good movement unhinges them  in their positions, both in zone defense \\nand obviously in man-for-man marking.  \\n \\nChanging the direction of play.  \\n \\nCan be achieved with long diagonal passes from flank-t o-flank, with crossover runs which have \\nthe purpose of drawing defenders together to create space down either flank. Reverse passing - \\na skill that involves running with the ball in one d irection, and passing it the opposite direction \\nshould also be used.  \\n \\nDribbling.  \\n \\nDribbling is the most exciting attacking tactic. When  a crowd sees a good dribbler it excites \\nthem. A player who can take on and beat others or draw  defenders to him creates space if the \\nball is delivered at the right time for his teammat es to exploit. It also creates an advantage to his \\nteam in terms of numbers once he beats and passes a d efender.  \\n \\nWall Pass.   \\n \\nGiving the ball to a teammate who plays it back to you  one-touch to enable you to go forward.  \\nThe \"cue\" to tell the receiver that the pass is \"on\" is a fast ball played in which tells the receiver \\nthere is space behind him which can be exploited.   \\n \\nThird Man Running.  \\n \\nThird man running is a tactic which best describes pass and move football. As the description of \\nthe tactic implies, it involves three players - a pas ser, a receiver and a runner. Again, to be \\neffective, there must be space for the runner to move  in to. The ball is played up to a receiver, \\nlaid off at an angle to the passer and played one to uch into the path of the runner.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCopyright, TheICA.com  All Rights Reserved ', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf11.pdf', 'page': 17}), Document(page_content=' 19  Attacking Width  - Good, wide players who \\nhave pace and who can dribble are \\ninvaluable to a team.  \\n \\nObviously since defenders wish to deny the opposition space and attackers wish to exploit space, \\nthen the principle of width is used.

Six factors, representing 12 different styles of play (eight\\n15 attacking and four defensive), had eigenvalues greater than 1 and explained 87.54% of the total\\nvariance.

Moreover, teams could use\\nspecific training drills directed to improve their styles of play.ARTICLE HISTORY\\nAccepted 17 March 2016\\nKEYWORDS\\nAssociation football; match\\nanalysis; tactics; factor analysis;\\nPremier League; La Liga\\nIntroduction\\nStrategies and tactics are important factors that influence the\\n25 outcome of the game and the final result in soccer (Yiannakos\\n& Armatas, 2006 ). A strategy is defined as the overall plan that\\nis devised and adopted to achieve an aim or specific objective,\\nand is normally accomplished via the application of specific\\ntactics (Carling, Williams, & Reilly, 2005 ). For example, soccer\\n30 teams adopt an overall combination of attacking and defen-\\nsive styles of play that would increase their probability of\\nsuccess. A style of play could be considered as the generalbehaviour of the whole team to achieve the attacking and\\ndefensive objectives in the game. Performance indicators are a\\n35 selection of action variables that try to define the aspects of a\\nperformance (Hughes & Bartlett, 2002 ) and can be associated\\nwith attacking and defensive tactics in soccer. Previous studieshighlighted the influence of styles of play when measuringperformance indicators related to physical (Buchheit &\\n40 Laursen, 2013 ; Reilly, 2005 ), technical and tactical aspects in\\nsoccer (Bradley et al., 2011 ; Duarte, Araújo, Correia, & Davids,\\n2012 ; James, Mellalieu, & Hollely, 2002 ; Lago-Peñas, Lago-\\nBallesteros, & Rey, 2011 ; Pollard & Reep, 1997 ; Pollard, Reep,\\n& Hartley, 1988 ; Tenga, Holme, Ronglan, & Bahr, 2010b ; Tenga\\n45 & Sigmundstad, 2011 ). For instance, styles of play affect phy-\\nsical performance indicators such as distance covered by theplayers or high -intensity running activities, due to players ’\\ndifferent movements as a result of specific behaviours typical\\nof a style of play. Moreover, styles of play can also affect\\n50 technical and tactical performance indicators such asindividual playing area (Fradua et al., 2013 ), percentage of\\nball possession (Lago & Martín, 2007 ; Lago-Peñas & Dellal,\\n2010 ), distance of passes and passing distribution (Tenga &\\nLarsen, 2003 ). These studies showed that styles of play should\\n55 be accounted for during data interpretation.\\nPrevious studies have identified attacking and defending\\nstyles of play. High pressure and low pressure have for exam-\\nple been defined as defending styles (Bangsbo & Peitersen,\\n2000 ; Wright, Atkins, Polman, Jones, & Sargeson, 2011 ). These\\n60 two defending styles of play are characterised by the specific\\nlocation on the pitch where teams apply defensive pressure\\non the opponent in possession, considering pressure as redu-\\ncing the distance to player in possession and other nearopponents in order to regain the ball as quick lyas possible.\\n65 For example, if defending players apply pressure in areascloser to the opponent ’s goal, they will be utilising the “high\\npressure ”style. In contrast, the “low pressure ”style of play\\ninvolves the defensive players only applying pressure on theopponents in the defensive half of the pitch.\\n70 Attacking styles of play have previously been defined as\\ndirect, possession, counterattacking, total soccer and crossing\\n(Bangsbo & Peitersen, 2000 ; Pollard et al., 1988 ).“Direct ”and\\n“possession” styles of play are the most commonly described\\nattacking styles (Bate, 1988 ; Garganta, Maia, & Basto, 1997 ;\\n75 Hughes & Franks, 2005 ; Olsen & Larsen, 1997 ; Redwood-\\nBrown, 2008 ; Ruiz-Ruiz, Fradua, Fernández-GarcÍa, &\\nZubillaga, 2013; Tenga, Holme, Ronglan, & Bahr, 2010a ;\\nTenga et al., 2010b ; Tenga & Larsen, 2003 ; Tenga, Ronglan, &\\nCONTACT Javier Fernandez-Navarro javierfernandez@ugr.es Faculty of Sport Sciences, Carretera de Alfacar s/n, 18011, Granada, SpainJOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES, 2016\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2016.1169309\\n© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis GroupC/e: AM C/e QA: DP', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Bahr, 2010 ; Travassos, Davids, Araujo, & Esteves, 2013 ). In\\n80 contrast to “possession” style, “direct” play is characterised\\nby longer passes, low number of passes, short passing\\nsequences and a low number of touches per ball involvement.\\nGame control was also a performance indicator associated\\nwith these styles of play, and was employed by a recent\\n85 study that utilised indexes calculated from different perfor-\\nmance indicators to evaluate the use of the possession and\\ndirect styles of play in elite teams (Kempe, Vogelbein,\\nMemmert, & Nopp, 2014 ). These indexes included several\\npassing and ball possession parameters to measure tactical\\n90 behaviour of teams. In addition, attacking styles such as“counterattacking play ”(Bangsbo & Peitersen, 2000 ),“total\\nsoccer ”(Bangsbo & Peitersen, 2000 ; Carling et al., 2005 ) and\\n“crossing ”(Pollard et al., 1988 ) have been defined but with no\\nor little information on the key performance indicators for\\n95 each of these styles.\\nA previous study that provided information on the perfor-\\nmance indicators for different styles of play was a quantitative\\ncomparison between the styles of play used by English league\\nteams during season 1984 –1985, and national teams that\\n100 played in the 1982 World Cup (Pollard et al., 1988 ). Six perfor-\\nmance indicators were measured and factor analysis was usedto define the different styles of play for the teams observed.\\nThe study identified three factors :factor 1 distinguished\\nbetween direct and possession (elaborate) styles ;factor 2\\n105 explained the use of crosses ;finally, factor 3 made a distinc-\\ntion between a style that entails regaining the possession\\ncloser to the opponent ’s or own goal. Each team’ s depen-\\ndence on a style was categorised on the basis of their factor\\nscore for the style of play.\\n110 Performance indicators associated with styles of play have\\nbeen described in parts (Bate, 1988 ; Hughes & Franks, 2005 ;\\nLago-Peñas & Dellal, 2010 ; Pollard et al., 1988 ; Tenga et al.,\\n2010b ; Tenga & Larsen, 2003 ) ;however ,there is no consensus\\nand/or missing information for some styles. For example,\\n115 Tenga and Larsen ( 2003 ) describe direct play as attacks invol-\\nving direct set plays, counter-attacks, attacks with at least onelong pass, attacks with a maximum of two passes, and attacks\\nmoving fast over and through midfield. In contrast, Hughes\\nand Franks ( 2005 ) consider low passing sequences as the key\\n120 performance indicator for direct play. Previous research sug-\\ngests that performance indicators for the different styles of\\nplay are unclear and that additional indicators should be\\nexamined to analyse styles of play. Hence, direction of passes\\nand ball possession in different areas could be, for instance,\\n125 important performance indicators when trying to identify\\nstyles of play. Moreover, additional defensive performance\\nindicators should be considered such as areas where defend-\\ning teams apply pressure, or time required to recover ball\\npossession (Vogelbein, Nopp, & Hökelmann, 2014 ). In addition,\\n130 soccer involves an interaction between attack and defence\\n(Moura et al., 2013 ), and this interaction makes it difficult to\\nquantify team performance indicators and tactics without con-\\nsidering the opposition’ s ones. Consequently, attacking and\\ndefensive behaviours of teams should be measured to account\\n135 for this interaction. The aim of the study was to define differ-ent styles of play in elite soccer and identify the associated\\nperformance indicators. A secondary aim was to classify theteams observed based on the styles so that a playing style\\nprofile can be created.\\n140 Methods\\nMatch sample\\nA total sample of 97 matches from the Spanish La Liga and theEnglish Premier League involving 37 different teams were\\ncollected for the study. Matches were monitored using a\\n145 multiple camera match analysis system (Amisco Pro®, version\\n1.0.2, Nice, France). From the total sample, 72 matches corre-\\nsponded to season 2006 –2007, 40 matches from the Spanish\\nLa Liga and 32 matches from the English Premier League.\\nThese two group of matches involved 18 and 15 different\\n150 teams ,respectively. Furthermore, 25 matches corresponded\\nto season 2010 –2011 and were from the Spanish La Liga.\\nThis group of matches involved 16 different teams.\\nTeams that participated in both seasons were considered as\\ndifferent teams due to possible changes in the squad and\\n155 technical staff of each team. These changes can lead to a\\ndifferent style of play. Moreover, teams with only one match\\navailable were excluded from the analysis as it was considered\\nthat one match is not enough of a sample to define a team’ s\\nstyle of play. Accordingly, 37 different teams were included in\\n160 the analysis. From the overall sample, there were at least fourmatches available for 15 teams, three matches available for\\neight teams and two matches available for 14 teams. The\\npresent study follows the research ethics guidelines set out\\nby Liverpool John Moores University.\\n165 Procedure\\nA total of 19 performance indicators (14 attacking and 5defen-\\nsive) were included in the study. Previous research relating to\\ntactics was considered when selecting the following performance\\nindicators for the study :possession of the ball (Jones, James, &\\n170 Mellalieu, 2004;L a g o&M a r t í n ,2007), crosses (Lago-Peñas, Lago-\\nBallesteros, Dellal, & Gomez, 2010;P o l l a r de ta l . ,1988) and shots\\n(Hughes & Franks, 2005 ; Lago-Ballesteros & Lago-Peñas, 2010;\\nPollard & Reep, 1997). The remaining performance indicators,\\nprovided by the Amisco® system, were considered to be relevant\\n175 to determine styles of play due to the importance of the spatial\\noccurrence of the events for measuring tactical aspects\\n(Castellano, Alva rez, Figueira, Coutinho, & Sampaio, 2013). The\\nattacking and defensive performance indicators, description andmeasurement methods are presented in Table 1 . For the follow-\\n180 ing performance indicators presented in Table 1 : 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 15,\\n16 and 17; the pitch was divided into three spaces parallel to the\\ngoal lines to collect the data (see Figure 1 ). In addition, for the\\nfollowing performance indicators presented in Table 1:5 ,6 ,1 8 and 19; the pitch was divided into three spaces parallel to the\\n185 touchlines to collect the data (see Figure 1 ). Passing direction was\\nalso considered to measure the following performance indicators\\ninTable 1:7 ,8 ,9 and 10. Trajectories of passes were categorised\\naccording to the diagram in Figure 2 .\\nFor the analysis, a team mean score for each performance\\n190 indicator was calculated and recorded using Microsoft Excel\\n(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA).2 J. FERNANDEZ-NAVARRO ET AL.', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='Statistical analysis\\nExploratory factor analysis using principal component analysis\\n(PCA) was conducted on 19 performance indicators with\\n195 orthogonal rotation (varimax).

Forwards passes Percentage of passes from the overall number of passes made by\\nthe team that are made forwards (towards the opposite goal).The Amisco system provided the direction of the movements of\\nthe ball by looking at the point where the pass started and the\\npoint where the pass was received.

The Kaiser –Meyer –Olkin mea-\\nsure (Kaiser, 1974 ) and communalities values after extraction\\n(MacCallum, Widaman, Zhang, & Hong, 1999 ) were employed\\nto verify the sampling adequacy for the analysis. Adequacy of\\n215 correlations between items was done according to Bartlett ’s\\ntest of sphericity. Kaiser’ s criterion of 1 (Kaiser, 1960 ) and\\ninterpretation of the scree plot were considered for factor\\nretention. Performance indicators with factor loadings greater\\nthan |0.7| showed a strong positive or negative correlation and\\n220 indicated a substantial value for factor interpretation (Comrey\\n& Lee, 2013 ).\\nResults\\nThe Kaiser– Meyer –Olkin (KMO) measure verified the sampling\\nadequacy for the analysis, KMO = 0.53, and the communalities\\n225 after extraction were greater than 0.7 in 18 of 19 performanceindicators, deeming sample size to be adequate for factor\\nanalysis. Bartlett ’s test of sphericity ( χ\\n2¼2254 :53 , df = 171,\\nP< 0.001) indicated that correlations between items were\\nsufficiently large for PCA. Six components had eigenvalues\\n230 over Kaiser ’s criterion of 1 and in combination explained\\n87.54% of the total variance ( Table 2). The percentage of\\nvariance explained by each factor decreased from factor 1 to\\n6. The scree plot was slightly ambiguous and showed inflexionpoints that would justify retaining four or six factors.\\n235 Therefore, six factors were extracted following the Kaiser’ s\\ncriterion as the number of performance indicators was less\\nthan 30 and communalities after extraction were greater than\\n0.7 (Stevens, 2009 ). The rotated component matrix for the\\nfactor loadings identified the performance indicators asso-\\n240 ciated with each factor ( Table 3).\\nDescriptions of factors were interpreted based on the\\ngroup of associated performance indicators. Factor 1 (posses-\\nsion directness) defines how direct a team’ s possession is. A\\nteam with a positive score in this factor tends to use a direct\\n245 (D) style. In contrast, a team with a negative score adopts amore elaborate, possession (P) style. Factor 2 (width of ball\\nregain) defines teams that pressure and regain the ball in wide\\nareas (PW) or in the central areas (PC) of the pitch. A team with\\na positive score regain more balls close to the touchline,\\n250 whereas a team with a negative score regain more balls in\\nthe central areas. Factor 3 (use of crosses) distinguish between\\ncrossing (C) and no crossing (NC) styles. This factor defines a\\nteam’ s use of crosses and how much possession of the ball\\nthey have in the defensive third. These performance indicators\\n255 correlate highly, consequently a team that scores positively onthis factor have a higher percentage of possession in the\\ndefensive third and use crosses to finish the attack. Factor 4\\n(possession width) defines teams that tend to play in wider\\nareas of the pitch using a wide possession (WP) style if they\\n260 score positively on this factor. In contrast, teams that score\\nnegatively tend to use central areas of the pitch to develop\\nthe attack using a narrow possession (NP) style. Factor 5\\n(defensive ball pressure) defines teams that use a high -or\\nlow -pressure style of play. A positive score defines a low-\\n265 pressure (LP) style, whereas a negative score defines a high-pressure (HP) style. Finally, a positive score on factor 6 (pro-\\ngression of the attack) defines teams that employ a fast pro-\\ngression (FP) style and usually progress straight to the\\nopponent ’s goal, whereas negative scoring teams utilise a\\n270 slow progression (SP) and tend to use more maintenance\\npasses to supporting players behind the position of the ball\\nto look for better options to progress to the opponent ’s goal.\\nFigure 1. Pitch divisions in three thirds parallel to the goal lines and parallel to the touchlines.\\nFigure 2. Direction of passes.4 J.

For example, the team scores for factor 1 are\\nplotted against the scores for the other attacking factors (see\\nFigure 3(A ) – C). Factor 1 was used to plot against the other\\nfactors because it explained the highest amount of variance\\n280 (27.8%). In addition, team scores for the defensive factors 2and 5 are plotted in Figure 3(D ).\\nDiscussion\\nDefining different styles of play that soccer teams can adopt\\nduring a match may be important when analysing perfor-\\n285 mance data. Therefore, the aim of the study was to identify\\nand define the styles of play in elite soccer. Exploratory factoranalysis extracted six factors that defined 12 different playing\\nstyles, split into eight attacking and four defending styles.\\nEach factor defined two different styles of play based on a290 positive or negative factor score on the continuum.\\nFurthermore, a team’ s score on each factor indicates their\\nreliance on that specific style of play (see Table 4).\\nPossession directness (factor 1) explained the highest per-\\ncentage of variance and differentiates the previously reported\\n295 direct and possession styles (Bate, 1988 ; Garganta et al., 1997 ;\\nHughes & Franks, 2005 ; Olsen & Larsen, 1997 ; Redwood-\\nBrown, 2008 ; Ruiz-Ruiz et al., 2013 ; Tenga et al., 2010a ,\\n2010b ; Tenga & Larsen, 2003 ; Tenga et al., 2010 ; Travassos\\net al., 2013 ).“Sideways passes ” and “possession of the ball ”\\n300 were the performance indicators that correlated negatively\\nwith this factor and suggested a possession style. The indica-\\ntors that correlated positively and suggested a direct style\\nwere “possession of the ball ”and “sideways passes ”. The\\nperformance indicator “passes from defensive to attacking\\n305 third” was also included for direct style of play interpretation\\nas it showed a high positive score loading for factor 1.

It is suggested\\nthat the tactical principle of playing sideways causes imbal-\\nances in the opposition ’s defen ce, therefore increasing the\\nsuccess of the attacking sequence and the opportunity to\\n315 score a goal (Tenga et al., 2010a ,2010b ; Tenga et al., 2010 ;\\nTenga & Sigmundstad, 2011 ). Previously, a direct style was\\ndescribed as being more advantageous than the possession\\nstyle (Bate, 1988 ; Garganta et al., 1997 ). However, Hughes and\\nFranks ( 2005 ) stated that, for successful teams, possession\\n320 style produced more goals per possession than the direct\\nstyle. In comparison, Tenga et al. ( 2010a ) reported no differ-\\nence in goals scored between these styles. Possibly, the long\\nand short passing abilities and skill of players influence the\\neffectiveness of a direct or possession style. Moreover, oppo-\\n325 nent ’s defensive style of play can also have an impact on the\\nteam ’s direct or possession style.\\nFactor 2 differentiates two defensive styles; a style of play\\nthat implies regaining the ball close to the touchline, and a\\nstyle where ball is regained in the central areas of the pitch.\\n330 These styles have not been reported previously. Styles of play\\ndifferentiated by factor 2 are associated with the performance\\nindicators “regains in the central areas of the pitch ”and\\n“regains in the wide areas of the pitch ”. Negative values for\\nthe former and positive values for the latter determine where\\n335 the team regains the ball. Wright et al. ( 2011 ) reported that\\ncentral ball regains are more likely to result in a scoring\\nattempt compared to wide ball regains. In addition, recent\\nstudies showed successful teams normally regain the ball in\\ncentral areas of the defensive and middle third (Barreira,\\n340 Garganta, Guimaraes, Machado, & Anguera, 2014 ; Barreira,\\nGarganta, Machado, & Anguera, 2014 ). This could possibly be\\nbecause central areas provide different options of passing tothe sides or forwards, whereas regaining the ball in the sides\\nlimit passing options due to the touchline. Furthermore, the\\n345 utilisation of these styles could depend on team formation\\n(number of players per area), player defensive abilities and/or\\nthe opponent ’s attacking abilities. Attacking styles of play of\\nthe opposition can also influence the defensive style of play\\nemployed by the team. Although the defensive team can lead\\n350 the opposition players to specific areas of the pitch for con-\\nducting an attack (e.g. ,accumulating players in central areas\\nand leaving free spaces on the sides for doing pressure to\\nopposition in wide areas), a prevalence of an attacking style of\\nplay used by the opposition can affect the defensive style\\n355 employed by the team.\\nFactor 3 defines two styles based on percentage of posses-\\nsion in the defensive third (i.e., time that the team control the\\nball near their own goal) combined with the use of crosses.\\nCorrelation between these indicators could suggest that\\n360 teams using crossing might have more ball possession in the\\ndefensive third so that wide players have time to move into\\nwide areas and execute a cross. Crossing is a tactic to create\\nthe chance of scoring (Ensum, Pollard, & Taylor, 2005 ; Hughes\\n& Churchill, 2005 ; Konstadinidou & Tsigilis, 2005 ; Lago-Peñas\\n365 et al., 2010 ,2011 ; Oberstone, 2009 ; Pollard, Ensum, & Taylor,\\n2004 ) ;however ,increases in scoring efficiency are not\\nreported consistently (Flynn, 2001 ). Crossing can also be a\\nrisk due to the possibility of losing the ball and produce a\\ncounter-attacking opportunity for opponents. Use of crosses\\n370 might be more effective for teams that adopt this style and\\nhave wide midfielders that employ long passing, strikers that\\ncreate space in the penalty area, win aerial challenges and\\nshot at goal with one touch (Carling et al., 2005 ; Ruiz-Ruiz\\net al., 2013 ). Moreover, this style could be useful when the\\n375 opposition lacks aerial abilities, as the probability of taking\\nadvantage of their mistakes would be increased.\\nFigure 3. Styles of play of soccer teams according tofactors. Attacking styles of play: (A) factor 1 and factor 3, (B) factor 1 and factor 4, (C) factor 1 and factor 6.\\nDefensive styles of play: (D) factor 2 and factor 5.6 J. FERNANDEZ-NAVARRO ET AL.', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='Possession width (factor 4), suggest the differentiation\\nbetween wide and narrow possession styles. These styles are\\nassociated with the percentage of ball possession teams have\\n380 in central or wide areas ;however ,it does not necessarily mean\\nthat they play wide or narrow in their attacking sequences.“Possession of the ball in the attacking third of the pitch ”,“pos-\\nsession of the ball in the central areas of the pitch ” and “posses-\\nsion of the ball in the wide areas of the pitch ”are the\\n385 performance indicators associated with this factor. The former\\nperformance indicator correlated highly with the latter, which\\ncould be due to easier maintenance of ball possession in attack-\\ning third wide areas compared to central areas. However, central\\nareas could be larger in surface, so caution should be applied\\n390 when interpreting this playing style. Moreover, due to the goal\\nposition, percentage of possession in central areas could be\\ninfluenced. Betis was the team, during season 2006 –2007, that\\nrelied the most on a wide possession style (see Table 4 ). The\\nposition of skilled players on the sides of the pitch and the use of\\n395 playing formations that accumulated players in these areas could\\nexplain the high score of this team for this style. Attacking thirdcentral areas are dangerous for defensive teams and result in\\nmore attempts at goal, therefore defensive actions will be more\\nintense (Pollard & Reep, 1997 ; Ruiz-Ruiz et al., 2013 ; Scoulding,\\n400 James, & Taylor, 2004 ; Tenga et al., 2010 ;W r i g h te ta l . , 2011 ;\\nYiannakos & Armatas, 2006 ). For example, British soccer teams\\n(2001 –2002) had more ball entries into central (60.3%) compared\\nto wide (39.7%) areas (James et al., 2002 ). Moreover, Hughes,\\nRobertson, and Nicholson ( 1988 ) suggested that successful\\n405 teams have more possession in the central compared to wide\\nareas. The use of a wide or narrow possession style will probably\\ndepend on the abilities of the wide and central players of the\\nteam. For example, teams with skilled wide midfielders and/or\\nfullbacks would utilise the wide possession style of play due to\\n410 the abilities of these players for maintaining ball possession.\\nOpponent ’s defensive style of play could also influence the use\\nof narrow or wide possession style.\\nFactor 5 identifies teams that use high -or low -pressure defen-\\nsive styles of play. “Number of regains in the attacking third ”was\\n415 the performance indicator that correlated negatively with this\\nfactor. Moreover, “passes from defensive to middle third ”alsoTable 4.

In\\n420 season 2006 –2007, Osasuna was the team that employed the\\nhigh-pressure style in the most emphasised way (see Table 4 ). A\\nhigh -pressure style could cause a risky situation for the defensive\\nteam due to the space produced behind the defensive players or\\nthe space between players in case that the team failed to keep\\n425 compactness. However, it can also influence scoring opportu-\\nnities because the ball can be regained closer to the opponent ’s\\ngoal, while increasing the likelihood of facing an imbalanced\\ndefen ce (Bell-Walker, McRobert, Ford, & Williams, 2006 ;\\nGarganta et al., 1997 ; Grant, Williams, Reilly, & Borrie, 1998 ;\\n430 Pollard & Reep, 1997 ;R u s s e l l , 2006 ; Scoulding et al., 2004 ;\\nWright et al., 2011 ). Successful teams from European Leagues\\nand World Cups tend to have higher attacking third regains (Bell-\\nWalker et al., 2006 ;G a r g a n t ae ta l . , 1997 ). Moreover, Tenga et al.\\n(2010a ) reported that the probability of producing a score-box\\n435 possession decreases when a balanced defen ce is present (i.e. ,\\ndefenders provide defensive backup and cover). The utilisation\\nof high -or low -pressure styles could be notably influenced by\\nthe opposing team ’s style of play (Cotta, Mora, Merelo-Molina, &\\nMerelo, 2013 ). For instance, using a high -pressure style of play\\n440 against a team that utilises a possession style of play could be\\nvery effective for regaining the ball due to time and space denied\\nto attacking players, while increasing the chances of scoring\\nopportunities.\\nFactor 6 describes team progression towards the opponent ’s\\n445 goal ;however ,it accounts for the lowest percentage of variance\\n(6.67%). The use of backward passes moves the ball further\\nfrom the opponent ’s goal; therefore ,an increase in backwards\\npasses is more likely to increase the time taken to reach the\\nopponent ’s goal. For this reason, a high quantity of backwards\\n450 passes could suggest a slow progression of possession. In con-\\ntrast, fewer backward passes would suggest a fast progression\\nof possession. These styles are not mentioned in previous\\nstudies, and the only performance indicator associated with\\nfactor 6 (i.e. ,“backwards passes ”) makes it complex to explain.\\n455 The progression of the possession factor could be associated\\nwith the directness ;however ,it is different. When using back-\\nwards passes the team tries to secure or support ball possession\\nby passing the ball to a less advanced team mate to create\\nspace and new opportunities to attack. For example, a team\\n460 that uses a direct style might also use backwards passes to\\ncreate a new opportunity for scoring. This team would have a\\nslow progression but also score high on possession directness\\n(e.g.,Bilbao in both seasons 2006 –2007 and 2010 –2011).\\nA secondary aim was to classify the team ’s styles so that\\n465 playing style profiles could be created for each team. Positive\\nor negative scores for the six factors would determine how\\nmuch a team relies on one specific style or combination of\\nthese styles. For example, in season 2006 –2007, Everton used\\nthe direct, no crossing, narrow and fast progression styles of\\n470 play in attack. In defen ce they used a low -pressure style while\\napplying pressure in central areas to regain the ball. Everton ’s\\nhigh score on factor 1 defines a direct style in attack due to\\nthe team ’s high percentage of forward passes, low percentage\\nof sideways passes and possession of the ball. In contrast,\\n475 during the 2006 –2007 season, Barcelona applied pressure incentral areas and used high -pressure defensive styles, com-\\nbined with possession, no crossing, narrow and fast progres-\\nsion attacking styles. Barcelona scored high on the percentage\\nof regains in the attacking third, which is one of the perfor-\\n480 mance indicators that define the high -pressure style.\\nMoreover, during the 2010 –2011 season, Barcelona adopted\\nalternative styles and intensified the use of previously used\\nstyles. They used the crossing, wide and slow progression\\nattacking styles, and increased their factor scores for the pos-\\n485 session attacking style, pressure in central areas and high -\\npressure defensive styles, compared to the 2006 –2007 season.\\nThese individual examples highlight how a team uses specific\\nattacking and defensive styles of play in a season. Moreover, in\\nthe case of Barcelona it highlights changes that occur in the\\n490 styles of play across two separate seasons, which could be due\\nto the tactical management of the coach and the players.\\nIn conclusion, 12 (eight attacking and four defensive) different\\nplaying styles and associated performance indicators utilised in\\nelite soccer were identified in this data set. Furthermore, the\\n495 selected factors together explained 87.54% of the variance. The\\ndegree to which a team relies on a specific style can be deter-\\nmined based on the team ’s score for each factor. Findings from\\nthis study have several practical implications for performance\\nanalysis. First, teams can objectively determine the styles they\\n500 use and their reliance on specific styles to create playing style\\nprofiles and normative profiles for associated performance indi-\\ncators. These profiles can be used to benchmark team ’sp e r f o r -\\nmance during competition or alternatively adjust their styles\\nbased on reference values they wish to adopt. Furthermore,\\n505 teams could use specific training drills to develop styles that\\nthey will employ in competition while using the associated\\nperformances indicators to monitor change. Second, playing\\nstyles profiling can be used on opponents to identify their domi-\\nnant styles and benchmark their performance indicators. This\\n510 data could be used to prepare tactics that would perturb the\\nopponent ’s dominant style(s) and identify strengths and weak-\\nnesses of the opposition. Third, recruitment analysts could intro-\\nduce playing styles profiling into their analysis framework when\\nidentifying individual players that they wish to integrate into the\\n515 team. Finally, previous research provided contradictory evidence\\nwhen measuring performance indicators associated with success\\nin isolation of factors (i.e., style of play, home advantage, type of\\ncompetition, quality of opponents and quality of team) that\\nmight affect the value. Therefore, differences in performance\\n520 indicators might be a factor of their playing styles. Researchers\\nshould be aware of these different styles and may integrate this\\ninto their analysis. Limitations of this study should be noted.\\nContextual variables (e.g. ,playing home/away, opposition level)\\nwere not measured and these variables could affect styles of play\\n525 used by teams. These variables could also explain the missed\\npercentage of the variance. Moreover, interaction process should\\nbe considered for a more accurate analysis of styles of play as\\nopponent ’s tactics can also influence the style of play employed\\nby a team. This study provides an introduction to analysing\\n530 playing styles. More variables and matches should be considered\\nto supply conclusive definitions for playing styles and generali-\\nsability of the data. Further research should attempt to establish\\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of playing styles when measur-\\ning performance and outcomes (i.e., scoring probability).8 J.

When matches are played in accordance with format (a) or (b), home matches may not be played in another country without the express permission of the FIFA Organising Committee.\\n6.  In the league format, the ranking in each group is determined as follows:\\na)  greatest number of points obtained in all group matches;b)  goal difference in all group matches;c) greatest number of goals scored in all group matches.\\n  If two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria, \\ntheir rankings will be determined as follows:\\nd) greatest number of points obtained in the group matches between \\nthe teams concerned;\\ne) goal difference resulting from the group matches between the \\nteams concerned;\\nf) greater number of goals scored in all group matches between the \\nteams concerned;\\ng) drawing of lots by the FIFA Organising Committee.\\n7.  With the approval of the FIFA Organising Committee and should the \\ncoordinated international match calendar allow, play-offs may be played instead of drawing lots to decide ties within groups (cf. art. 17, par. 6g). If any such play-off ends in a tie, extra time of two periods of 15 minutes each will be played. If the score is level after extra time, penalty kicks will be taken to determine the winner in accordance with the procedure described in the Laws of the Game.\\n8.  Should the best second- or third-placed team within a group stage qualify for the next stage or for the ﬁ  nal competition, the criteria to \\ndecide such best second- or third-placed team will depend on the competition format and will require the approval of FIFA following proposals from the confederations.', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf5.pdf', 'page': 12}), Document(page_content='22\\n 239.  In the knock-out format, both teams shall play one home and one \\naway match each, the sequence of which will be determined by lots drawn by the FIFA Organising Committee. The team having scored most goals over the two games will qualify for the next round. If both teams score the same number of goals over the two matches, the goals scored away will be counted as double. If the same number of goals is scored away or both matches end without any goals being scored, extra time of two periods of 15 minutes each will be played. If the score is level after extra time, penalty kicks will be taken to determine the winner in accordance with the procedure described in the Laws of the Game.\\n10.

We are also grateful to \\nthe tens of thousands of locals who welcomed us \\nwith genuine grace and warmth, and obviously to \\nall those who were involved in the running of the tournament, from the Local Organising Committee \\n(LOC) to the amazing volunteers and the FIFA \\nadministration. \\nFinally, although it goes without saying, we owe the \\nbiggest debt of all to those who played an active \\npart in this tournament becoming such a beacon of \\nhope and beauty. Therefore, a massive thank you to \\nthe players, coaches and officials, to the fans from \\nall over the world and to all those behind the scenes, \\nall of whom conducted themselves in an exemplary \\nmanner. Even with flawless organisation and \\nstadiums, a spectacle of such grandeur simply would \\nnot have been possible without these people. It is \\nundoubtedly thanks to them that we enjoyed every \\nsingle moment and that this fantastic World Cup will \\nlive for so long in the memory. In Russia, they made \\nus fall in love with our game all over again – a game \\nwith unique and unrivalled appeal, which belongs to \\neverybody and is for everybody, now and forever.', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf6.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='4\\n2018 FIFA World Cup RussiaTM\\nFrom a tactical perspective, the brand of football \\nwas very measured, but this did not have a \\nnegative impact. Indeed, the level was evenly \\nbalanced and almost every encounter was \\nimpassioned, enthralling and eagerly contested \\nright down to the very last minute. It is clear that \\nthe great tacticians are always searching for ways \\nto further control matches and minimise risk, \\nbut what was even more evident is that even the \\nbest-laid plans can suddenly mean nothing when \\nthe ball spins in an unexpected direction amid the \\nunpredictability of our beautiful game. However \\nwell prepared you are, matches can take an \\nunforeseen turn at any given moment as a result \\nof goals and other key incidents, whether these \\ncome about due to a mistake or a stroke of genius. \\nWe also saw that the pressing game was far less \\nprevalent than previously, in what is a highly \\nunderstandable development. At a tournament \\nof the magnitude of the World Cup, energy levels \\nand mental sharpness need to be conserved as \\nfar as possible and teams must focus on being \\nconsistent and having the ability to read matches \\nbetter than the opposition.\\nWe witnessed several traditional powerhouses \\nsurprisingly struggle. Germany and Spain did \\nnot appear to be fresh, Argentina were lacking \\na clear style of play and Brazil were unbalanced, \\nand they all ended up paying the price despite \\ntheir reputations. At the same time, we also saw \\na number of so-called “small” teams – the likes \\nof Japan, Senegal and Korea Republic, to name \\nbut a few – closing the gap tactically but then \\nfalling just short of really going to the next level. \\nUruguay, Sweden and Mexico, three other historic \\nnames, produced some good performances but \\ndid not manage to cause a shock in the knockout \\nstage. Then there were hosts Russia, whose fairy-tale turnaround in form had a whole nation \\ndreaming of glory.\\nFrance were worthy winners. Under the steady \\nstewardship of Didier Deschamps, who had a clear \\nand precise vision of how to make the most of the \\nplayers at his disposal and go all the way, they were \\nthe most settled and assured performers overall.\\nThe biggest surprise package were Croatia, who \\ngave millions around the world hope that one of \\nthe “small” teams could actually win the World \\nCup. Driven on by an exceptional Luka Modrić, the \\nCroatian side never lost their composure or focus, \\ndemonstrating remarkable maturity, character and \\nspirit. Meanwhile, Belgium were great entertainers \\nand England finally began to deliver on their \\npotential.\\nThe World Cup served up many other enjoyable \\nand unique stories, but this report focuses on \\nthe numbers and the in-depth analysis of the \\nFIFA Technical Study Group. It is an outstanding \\ntestimony to everything that took place on and \\noff the pitch during Russia 2018, an unforgettable \\nWorld Cup that will also go down as a milestone for \\nrefereeing. The revolution that is the VAR system \\nfills us with pride and over time we will see even \\nmore clearly how beneficial it is for the entire world \\nof football. Just as importantly, this progress has \\nbeen achieved without affecting the game, because \\nthe essence and traditions of football must always \\nbe preserved in all their glory.\\nYours in football,\\nZvonimir Boban', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf6.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='5\\n2018 FIFA World Cup RussiaTM\\nThe FIFA Coaching & Player Development Department was responsible for the activities of the Technical Study \\nGroup, which comprised the following members: \\nMarco van Basten (FIFA Chief Technical Development Officer), Carlos Alberto Parreira (Brazil) – Head of the TSG, \\nEmmanuel Amunike (Nigeria), Bora Milutinović (Serbia), Andy Roxburgh (Scotland), Branimir Ujević (FIFA TSG \\nProject Leader) and Pascal Zuberbühler (FIFA Goalkeeping Specialist).\\nFrom left to right: Branimir Ujević, Carlos Alberto Parreira, Emmanuel Amunike, Marco van Basten, Andy Roxburgh, \\nBora Milutinović, Pascal ZuberbühlerTECHNICAL STUDY GROUP \\n', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf6.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='62018 FIFA World Cup RussiaTM\\nTOURNAMENT OBSERVATION\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf6.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='7\\n2018 FIFA World Cup RussiaTM\\nGOAL ANALYSIS\\n“The attackers looked very sharp: they created good opportunities \\nand took them! The midfielders got forward in support and chipped in \\nwith goals. There was an attacking mentality”\\nCARLOS ALBERTO PARREIRA\\n“In the knockout phase,  \\nthe matches were more open”\\nMARCO VAN BASTEN\\n“A lack of pressure on the man with the ball is the main factor that \\nresults in shots on goal. That is the number-one reason for goals \\nbeing conceded in football and it won’t change any time soon”\\nCARLOS ALBERTO PARREIRA\\n“In the past, only some teams \\nused counter-attacks to great \\neffect, but most sides are capable \\nof doing so today”\\nEMMANUEL AMUNEKE There were some interesting stats in Russia and \\nsome new trends, too. This was a tournament of \\ngoals: we saw 169 goals, only two fewer than the \\nrecord for a 32-team World Cup, which was set at \\nFrance 1998 and equalled at Brazil 2014. Only one \\nmatch out of 64 ended goalless (Denmark v. France), \\ncompared to five in Brazil and seven at South \\nAfrica 2010. We also saw more goals scored in the \\nknockout stage than at the previous World Cup, up \\nfrom 35 to 47. \\nThis indicates that teams played with a lot of \\nattacking firepower and were very good at taking \\ntheir chances. The finishing was more clinical at \\nRussia 2018, with teams averaging a goal from every \\n9.8 shots, three fewer than at South Africa 2010. \\nBreaking this down further, shooting efficiency from \\noutside the penalty area improved dramatically: the \\naverage strike rate was a goal per 29 long-range \\nattempts, compared to one in 42 at Brazil 2014.\\nThere were several strong counter-attacking sides \\nat this World Cup and coaches were clearly wary of \\nthe threat of being caught on the break. One out of \\nevery two goals at Russia 2018 came from either set \\npieces or counter-attacks.\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf6.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='8\\n2018 FIFA World Cup RussiaTM\\n“As they say, ‘delivery is everything’”\\nCARLOS ALBERTO PARREIRA\\n “If I think back to my playing \\ndays, we didn’t spend a lot of \\ntime working on set pieces in \\ntraining – maybe five or ten \\nminutes. Today, more attention  \\nis being paid to these things”\\nMARCO VAN BASTEN\\n“It’s a special situation because \\nyou can push as many players \\nas you want into the box and \\npractise routines beforehand”\\nCARLOS ALBERTO PARREIRAApart from penalties, the biggest change at this year’s tournament in terms of set plays concerned corners. At \\nthe 2018 World Cup, one in every 29 corners led to a goal, whereas the figure was 61 at South Africa 2010 and \\n36 at Brazil 2014. This trend of superior effectiveness continued through the knockout stage in Russia, where \\nteams scored from one in every 31 corners compared to every 41 in Brazil. \\nSET PLAYS\\nThere were some good dead-ball specialists at the \\nWorld Cup in Russia and some good headers of the \\nball too. When you reach a stage when there’s not \\nmuch difference between teams and defences are very \\nwell organised, then set plays become a vital weapon. \\nA lot of the matches at this World Cup came down \\nto dead-ball situations. Eventual champions France \\noffered a prime example of the importance of set \\nplays at this tournament, notably in the semi-final \\nagainst Belgium and then again in the title decider. \\nIndeed, their first two goals in the final came from \\nset pieces: a free kick and a penalty. When a match is \\ntight, set plays can make all the difference and win \\ntrophies.\\nMoreover, the number of penalties awarded in the \\ngroup stage significantly increased from previous \\neditions, partly due to the presence of VAR.\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf6.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='92018 FIFA World Cup RussiaTM\\n“Teams hardly had a chance to shoot from outside the box”\\nMARCO VAN BASTEN\\n“Space between the lines  \\nwas practically non-existent  \\nat this World Cup”\\nCARLOS ALBERTO PARREIRA\\n“It is not possible to defend \\nin this manner without good \\ncommunication”\\nEMMANUEL AMUNEKE COMPACT DEFENDING\\nTeams at this World Cup were more compact in \\ndefence, with a tournament average of 26m between \\na side’s deepest defender and highest attacker out of \\npossession. The amount of space available has been \\ndramatically reduced, making it challenging to find \\nopenings.\\n“Players have to be very clever \\nand technically skilful to create \\nchances”\\nBORA MILUTINOVIĆ\\nA result of tight, compact defending is a decrease in \\nthe number of shots from outside the penalty area. \\nThis figure has dropped by a remarkable 32% since \\nSouth Africa 2010. Defending in this style requires \\nefficient organisation, good teamwork, awareness \\nand leadership, especially from the central defenders. \\nFrom an attacking perspective, the role of the \\ntraditional number 9 has become more challenging \\ndue to the limited space.

They \\nmust be defensively solid in 1v1 situations, strong in \\nthe tackle and effective at closing down opposition \\nattackers to deny them space. Full-backs perform a \\nbalancing act for the team. \\nHowever, they can be very useful in attack at the \\nright moments. Previously, the left- and right-sided \\nmidfielders almost exclusively occupied the wide \\nareas, operating as wingers, but the game has evolved \\nand this is no longer the case. We typically only used \\nto see one full-back joining in with attacks, whereas \\nnow both full-backs look to exploit the space down \\nthe flanks.\\nPlaying with a back three or five affects the defensive \\nand attacking responsibilities and impact of the wide \\nplayers. Nevertheless, regardless of whether they \\nare lining up in a 3-5-2 or a 5-3-2, they operate as \\nwing-backs. In general, fewer traditional overlaps are \\noccurring due to teams’ dynamic interchanging of \\npositions.', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf6.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='11\\n2018 FIFA World Cup RussiaTM\\n“I love watching Modrić  \\npull the strings in games;  \\nhe’s a class act”\\nBORA MILUTINOVIĆ“You cannot manufacture a maestro” \\nANDY ROXBURGH\\n“Playmakers can impose themselves on games,  \\nspeed up or slow down the tempo,  \\nswitch play, create and make things happen”\\nCARLOS ALBERTO PARREIRAIMPORTANCE OF THE PLAYMAKER\\nWe saw less of the so-called playmakers at this \\nWorld Cup, perhaps as a result of the way teams \\nplayed. However, there were still some outstanding \\nindividuals in this area.

Although Les Bleus made a bright start, \\nstars Kylian Mbappe, Paul Pogba and Antoine Griezmann were \\nunable to capitalise on their chances.

Samuel Umtiti then handled the \\nball in the box just a few minutes later, with Mile Jedinak \\nscoring the resulting spot-kick.

Playing a more patient \\ngame, the Danes were unable to generate any clear-cut \\nchances as the first half ended goalless.\\nAdopting a more adventurous approach after the restart, \\nDenmark were rewarded when Christian Eriksen’s precise \\nthrough-ball allowed Poulsen to open the scoring.

Despite stamping their \\nauthority on the game’s opening stages, La Albiceleste \\nstruggled to find space against a deep-lying Icelandic defence. \\nThe breakthrough came in the 19th minute when Sergio \\nAguero fired the ball home on the turn to give Argentina a 1-0 \\nlead. The South Americans’ joy was short-lived, however, as \\nAlfred Finnbogason made history by scoring his country’s first-\\never World Cup goal just four minutes later.\\nLionel Messi had the biggest opportunity to take the lead \\nin the second half, but his penalty was saved by Iceland \\ngoalkeeper Hannes Halldorsson. Although Argentina \\ncontinued to press for a goal, they were repeatedly denied by \\nthe Nordic side’s staunch defensive efforts.\\nSee match highlights:\\nArgentina v Iceland - 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ - Match 7\\nNo shots on target, one goal. The statistics at half-time during \\nCroatia’s meeting with Nigeria reflected an opening 45 \\nminutes shaded by the Balkan side – but largely dominated \\nby defenders. Ivan Perisic went closest to hitting the target \\nwith an effort from 20m after a quarter of an hour, but in the \\nend it was Nigeria’s Oghenekaro Etebo who brought joy to \\nthe huge Croatian contingent in Kaliningrad, beating his own \\ngoalkeeper following a corner.\\nCautious in the first half, Nigeria came out with more purpose \\nafter the break, only for Dejan Lovren and Domagoj Vida \\nto keep Odion Ighalo well and truly quiet. In fact, just as \\nthe Super Eagles began turning up the pressure on Danijel \\nSubasic’s goal, the *Vatreni* (The Fiery Ones) responded by \\ndoubling their lead, Luka Modric converting from the spot \\nafter William Ekong held Mario Mandzukic in the box. It \\nwas no less than Modric deserved after a superb display that \\nearned him the Budweiser Man of the Match award.\\nSee match highlights:\\nCroatia v Nigeria - 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ - Match 8Argentina v.

The Swiss hung \\nin, patiently putting moves together but without genuinely \\nthreatening. Blerim Dzemaili had their best chance half an \\nhour in, forcing Serbia keeper Vladimir Stojkovic to push the \\nball clear.\\nRejuvenated after the break, the Swiss took just seven \\nminutes to pull level, thanks to Granit Xhaka’s sublime drive \\nfrom outside the box. The angle of post and bar then denied \\nXherdan Shaqiri, though the diminutive Swiss forward would \\nhave the last laugh. Sprinting clear of the Serbian defence as \\ninjury time approached, Shaqiri planted the ball beneath the \\nadvancing Stojkovic to move his side into second place in the \\npool.\\nSee match highlights:\\nSerbia v Switzerland - 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ - Match 26Brazil v.

Though lacking imagination, Les Diables Rouges still \\ncreated the clearest chances, with Panama captain Roman \\nTorres working wonders to put a dangerous cross from Kevin \\nDe Bruyne out for a corner with 22 minutes gone.\\nFrustrated and empty-handed at the break, Romelu Lukaku, \\nEden Hazard and Dries Mertens returned reinvigorated, not \\nleast the Napoli man, who had the Belgium fans cheering \\nwhen he fired a sumptuous volley past Jaime Penedo just two \\nminutes into the second half. Having finally taken the lead, \\nthe men in red found their rhythm and the space in which to \\nexpress themselves, with Lukaku getting in on the act. After \\nopening his account with a header from a superb De Bruyne \\ncross, he coolly clipped the ball home following a penetrating \\nHazard run. At last Belgium could breathe easy, their World \\nCup campaign safely under way.

FORMAT OF COMPETITION \\n \\nThe 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ comprises two (2) d istinct phases: the Preliminary \\nCompetition and the Final Competition. These Media and Marketing Regulations govern (i) the \\nmanner in which all commercial rights relating to t he Final Competition may be exploited, and (ii) \\nthe manner in which the Media Rights and the Market ing Rights are protected for the benefit of \\nFIFA and the Member Associations.  \\n \\nThese Media and Marketing Regulations shall not app ly to the Preliminary Competition, as the \\nPreliminary Competition is governed separately by t he “2018 FIFA World Cup™ Preliminary \\nCompetition Media and Marketing Regulations”. \\n \\n \\n2. PURPOSE OF MEDIA AND MARKETING REGULATIONS  \\n \\nIn view of the prize money for the Final Competitio n of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ and in \\nview of the funds contributed by FIFA to the FIFA F orward Programme, it is important to \\nrecognise that the distribution of such substantial  sums and contribution of funds is only made \\npossible by the continuing support provided for the  FIFA World Cup™ by Commercial Affiliates \\nand Media Rights Licensees appointed by FIFA. Becau se Commercial Affiliates and Media Rights \\nLicensees have undertaken to pay significant amount s of money for the rights they have \\nacquired, FIFA has established these Media and Mark eting Regulations to ensure that all \\nMember Associations, in particular all Participatin g Member Associations only engage in the \\ncorrect exercise of the commercial rights which are  granted to them by FIFA, and to ensure that \\nthey (and their PMA Affiliates and any third party contracted to the Participating Member \\nAssociations) participate fully in protecting FIFA’ s commercial rights in the Final Competition. \\nUltimately, the proper implementation of these Medi a and Marketing Regulations will be of direct \\nbenefit, not only to the Participating Member Assoc iations, but to all Member Associations and the \\nsport of association football. \\n \\n2.1. Prize money \\nThe prize money paid by FIFA to the Member Associat ions participating in the FIFA World Cup™ \\nhas increased significantly for the final competiti ons of the 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014 editions of \\nthe FIFA World Cup™. These Media and Marketing Regu lations are designed to protect this \\nimportant source of revenue for the Member Associat ions participating in a FIFA World Cup™. \\n \\n2.2. FIFA Forward Programme \\nUnder the new development programme called “Forward ”, every year, FIFA contributes the sum of \\nUSD 1,250,000 to each Member Association and USD 10 ,000,000 per Confederation. Under the \\nFIFA Forward Programme, FIFA therefore allocates pe r year in total USD 323,750,000 to Member \\nAssociations and Confederations. In addition, the F IFA Forward Programme includes further \\ncontributions to less-privileged associations and r egional associations. The overall budget for the \\nFIFA Forward Programme for the cycle 2015-2018 amou nts to USD 1,417,000,000. \\n \\nThese Media and Marketing Regulations are designed to protect this source of revenue for the \\nMember Associations.

In the knockout format, both teams shall play one home and one away \\nmatch each, the sequence of which shall be determined by lots drawn by the FIFA Organising Committee. The team having scored most goals over the two games shall qualify for the next round. If both teams score the same number of goals over the two matches, the goals scored away shall be counted as double. If the same number of goals is scored away or both matches end without any goals being scored, extra time of two periods of 15 minutes each shall be played at the end of the second leg. The extra time shall be an integrant part of the second-leg match. Thus, if no goals are scored in extra time, kicks from the penalty mark shall be taken to determine the winner, in accordance with the procedure described in the Laws of the Game.

A strategy is defined as the overall plan that\\nis devised and adopted to achieve an aim or specific objective,\\nand is normally accomplished via the application of specific\\ntactics (Carling, Williams, & Reilly, 2005 ). For example, soccer\\n30 teams adopt an overall combination of attacking and defen-\\nsive styles of play that would increase their probability of\\nsuccess. A style of play could be considered as the generalbehaviour of the whole team to achieve the attacking and\\ndefensive objectives in the game. Performance indicators are a\\n35 selection of action variables that try to define the aspects of a\\nperformance (Hughes & Bartlett, 2002 ) and can be associated', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='with attacking and defensive tactics in soccer. Previous studieshighlighted the influence of styles of play when measuringperformance indicators related to physical (Buchheit &\\n40 Laursen, 2013 ; Reilly, 2005 ), technical and tactical aspects in\\nsoccer (Bradley et al., 2011 ; Duarte, Araújo, Correia, & Davids,\\n2012 ; James, Mellalieu, & Hollely, 2002 ; Lago-Peñas, Lago-\\nBallesteros, & Rey, 2011 ; Pollard & Reep, 1997 ; Pollard, Reep,\\n& Hartley, 1988 ; Tenga, Holme, Ronglan, & Bahr, 2010b ; Tenga\\n45 & Sigmundstad, 2011 ). For instance, styles of play affect phy-\\nsical performance indicators such as distance covered by theplayers or high -intensity running activities, due to players ’\\ndifferent movements as a result of specific behaviours typical\\nof a style of play. Moreover, styles of play can also affect\\n50 technical and tactical performance indicators such asindividual playing area (Fradua et al., 2013 ), percentage of\\nball possession (Lago & Martín, 2007 ; Lago-Peñas & Dellal,', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='2010 ), distance of passes and passing distribution (Tenga &\\nLarsen, 2003 ). These studies showed that styles of play should\\n55 be accounted for during data interpretation.\\nPrevious studies have identified attacking and defending\\nstyles of play. High pressure and low pressure have for exam-\\nple been defined as defending styles (Bangsbo & Peitersen,\\n2000 ; Wright, Atkins, Polman, Jones, & Sargeson, 2011 ). These\\n60 two defending styles of play are characterised by the specific\\nlocation on the pitch where teams apply defensive pressure\\non the opponent in possession, considering pressure as redu-\\ncing the distance to player in possession and other nearopponents in order to regain the ball as quick lyas possible.\\n65 For example, if defending players apply pressure in areascloser to the opponent ’s goal, they will be utilising the “high\\npressure ”style. In contrast, the “low pressure ”style of play', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='involves the defensive players only applying pressure on theopponents in the defensive half of the pitch.\\n70 Attacking styles of play have previously been defined as\\ndirect, possession, counterattacking, total soccer and crossing\\n(Bangsbo & Peitersen, 2000 ; Pollard et al., 1988 ).“Direct ”and\\n“possession” styles of play are the most commonly described\\nattacking styles (Bate, 1988 ; Garganta, Maia, & Basto, 1997 ;\\n75 Hughes & Franks, 2005 ; Olsen & Larsen, 1997 ; Redwood-\\nBrown, 2008 ; Ruiz-Ruiz, Fradua, Fernández-GarcÍa, &\\nZubillaga, 2013; Tenga, Holme, Ronglan, & Bahr, 2010a ;\\nTenga et al., 2010b ; Tenga & Larsen, 2003 ; Tenga, Ronglan, &\\nCONTACT Javier Fernandez-Navarro javierfernandez@ugr.es Faculty of Sport Sciences, Carretera de Alfacar s/n, 18011, Granada, SpainJOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES, 2016\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2016.1169309\\n© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis GroupC/e: AM C/e QA: DP', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Bahr, 2010 ; Travassos, Davids, Araujo, & Esteves, 2013 ). In\\n80 contrast to “possession” style, “direct” play is characterised\\nby longer passes, low number of passes, short passing\\nsequences and a low number of touches per ball involvement.\\nGame control was also a performance indicator associated\\nwith these styles of play, and was employed by a recent\\n85 study that utilised indexes calculated from different perfor-\\nmance indicators to evaluate the use of the possession and\\ndirect styles of play in elite teams (Kempe, Vogelbein,\\nMemmert, & Nopp, 2014 ). These indexes included several\\npassing and ball possession parameters to measure tactical\\n90 behaviour of teams. In addition, attacking styles such as“counterattacking play ”(Bangsbo & Peitersen, 2000 ),“total\\nsoccer ”(Bangsbo & Peitersen, 2000 ; Carling et al., 2005 ) and\\n“crossing ”(Pollard et al., 1988 ) have been defined but with no\\nor little information on the key performance indicators for\\n95 each of these styles.', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='A previous study that provided information on the perfor-\\nmance indicators for different styles of play was a quantitative\\ncomparison between the styles of play used by English league\\nteams during season 1984 –1985, and national teams that\\n100 played in the 1982 World Cup (Pollard et al., 1988 ). Six perfor-\\nmance indicators were measured and factor analysis was usedto define the different styles of play for the teams observed.\\nThe study identified three factors :factor 1 distinguished\\nbetween direct and possession (elaborate) styles ;factor 2\\n105 explained the use of crosses ;finally, factor 3 made a distinc-\\ntion between a style that entails regaining the possession\\ncloser to the opponent ’s or own goal. Each team’ s depen-\\ndence on a style was categorised on the basis of their factor\\nscore for the style of play.\\n110 Performance indicators associated with styles of play have\\nbeen described in parts (Bate, 1988 ; Hughes & Franks, 2005 ;', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='Lago-Peñas & Dellal, 2010 ; Pollard et al., 1988 ; Tenga et al.,\\n2010b ; Tenga & Larsen, 2003 ) ;however ,there is no consensus\\nand/or missing information for some styles. For example,\\n115 Tenga and Larsen ( 2003 ) describe direct play as attacks invol-\\nving direct set plays, counter-attacks, attacks with at least onelong pass, attacks with a maximum of two passes, and attacks\\nmoving fast over and through midfield. In contrast, Hughes\\nand Franks ( 2005 ) consider low passing sequences as the key\\n120 performance indicator for direct play. Previous research sug-\\ngests that performance indicators for the different styles of\\nplay are unclear and that additional indicators should be\\nexamined to analyse styles of play. Hence, direction of passes\\nand ball possession in different areas could be, for instance,\\n125 important performance indicators when trying to identify\\nstyles of play. Moreover, additional defensive performance\\nindicators should be considered such as areas where defend-', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='ing teams apply pressure, or time required to recover ball\\npossession (Vogelbein, Nopp, & Hökelmann, 2014 ). In addition,\\n130 soccer involves an interaction between attack and defence\\n(Moura et al., 2013 ), and this interaction makes it difficult to\\nquantify team performance indicators and tactics without con-\\nsidering the opposition’ s ones. Consequently, attacking and\\ndefensive behaviours of teams should be measured to account\\n135 for this interaction. The aim of the study was to define differ-ent styles of play in elite soccer and identify the associated\\nperformance indicators. A secondary aim was to classify theteams observed based on the styles so that a playing style\\nprofile can be created.\\n140 Methods\\nMatch sample\\nA total sample of 97 matches from the Spanish La Liga and theEnglish Premier League involving 37 different teams were\\ncollected for the study.

In\\n420 season 2006 –2007, Osasuna was the team that employed the\\nhigh-pressure style in the most emphasised way (see Table 4 ). A\\nhigh -pressure style could cause a risky situation for the defensive\\nteam due to the space produced behind the defensive players or\\nthe space between players in case that the team failed to keep\\n425 compactness. However, it can also influence scoring opportu-\\nnities because the ball can be regained closer to the opponent ’s\\ngoal, while increasing the likelihood of facing an imbalanced\\ndefen ce (Bell-Walker, McRobert, Ford, & Williams, 2006 ;\\nGarganta et al., 1997 ; Grant, Williams, Reilly, & Borrie, 1998 ;\\n430 Pollard & Reep, 1997 ;R u s s e l l , 2006 ; Scoulding et al., 2004 ;\\nWright et al., 2011 ).

Moreover, Tenga et al.\\n(2010a ) reported that the probability of producing a score-box\\n435 possession decreases when a balanced defen ce is present (i.e. ,\\ndefenders provide defensive backup and cover). The utilisation\\nof high -or low -pressure styles could be notably influenced by\\nthe opposing team ’s style of play (Cotta, Mora, Merelo-Molina, &\\nMerelo, 2013 ). For instance, using a high -pressure style of play\\n440 against a team that utilises a possession style of play could be\\nvery effective for regaining the ball due to time and space denied\\nto attacking players, while increasing the chances of scoring\\nopportunities.\\nFactor 6 describes team progression towards the opponent ’s\\n445 goal ;however ,it accounts for the lowest percentage of variance\\n(6.67%). The use of backward passes moves the ball further', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='from the opponent ’s goal; therefore ,an increase in backwards\\npasses is more likely to increase the time taken to reach the\\nopponent ’s goal. For this reason, a high quantity of backwards\\n450 passes could suggest a slow progression of possession. In con-\\ntrast, fewer backward passes would suggest a fast progression\\nof possession. These styles are not mentioned in previous\\nstudies, and the only performance indicator associated with\\nfactor 6 (i.e. ,“backwards passes ”) makes it complex to explain.\\n455 The progression of the possession factor could be associated\\nwith the directness ;however ,it is different. When using back-\\nwards passes the team tries to secure or support ball possession\\nby passing the ball to a less advanced team mate to create\\nspace and new opportunities to attack. For example, a team\\n460 that uses a direct style might also use backwards passes to\\ncreate a new opportunity for scoring. This team would have a', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='slow progression but also score high on possession directness\\n(e.g.,Bilbao in both seasons 2006 –2007 and 2010 –2011).\\nA secondary aim was to classify the team ’s styles so that\\n465 playing style profiles could be created for each team. Positive\\nor negative scores for the six factors would determine how\\nmuch a team relies on one specific style or combination of\\nthese styles. For example, in season 2006 –2007, Everton used\\nthe direct, no crossing, narrow and fast progression styles of\\n470 play in attack. In defen ce they used a low -pressure style while\\napplying pressure in central areas to regain the ball. Everton ’s\\nhigh score on factor 1 defines a direct style in attack due to\\nthe team ’s high percentage of forward passes, low percentage\\nof sideways passes and possession of the ball. In contrast,\\n475 during the 2006 –2007 season, Barcelona applied pressure incentral areas and used high -pressure defensive styles, com-\\nbined with possession, no crossing, narrow and fast progres-', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='sion attacking styles. Barcelona scored high on the percentage\\nof regains in the attacking third, which is one of the perfor-\\n480 mance indicators that define the high -pressure style.\\nMoreover, during the 2010 –2011 season, Barcelona adopted\\nalternative styles and intensified the use of previously used\\nstyles. They used the crossing, wide and slow progression\\nattacking styles, and increased their factor scores for the pos-\\n485 session attacking style, pressure in central areas and high -\\npressure defensive styles, compared to the 2006 –2007 season.\\nThese individual examples highlight how a team uses specific\\nattacking and defensive styles of play in a season. Moreover, in\\nthe case of Barcelona it highlights changes that occur in the\\n490 styles of play across two separate seasons, which could be due\\nto the tactical management of the coach and the players.\\nIn conclusion, 12 (eight attacking and four defensive) different\\nplaying styles and associated performance indicators utilised in', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='elite soccer were identified in this data set. Furthermore, the\\n495 selected factors together explained 87.54% of the variance. The\\ndegree to which a team relies on a specific style can be deter-\\nmined based on the team ’s score for each factor. Findings from\\nthis study have several practical implications for performance\\nanalysis. First, teams can objectively determine the styles they\\n500 use and their reliance on specific styles to create playing style\\nprofiles and normative profiles for associated performance indi-\\ncators. These profiles can be used to benchmark team ’sp e r f o r -\\nmance during competition or alternatively adjust their styles\\nbased on reference values they wish to adopt. Furthermore,\\n505 teams could use specific training drills to develop styles that\\nthey will employ in competition while using the associated\\nperformances indicators to monitor change. Second, playing\\nstyles profiling can be used on opponents to identify their domi-', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='nant styles and benchmark their performance indicators. This\\n510 data could be used to prepare tactics that would perturb the\\nopponent ’s dominant style(s) and identify strengths and weak-\\nnesses of the opposition. Third, recruitment analysts could intro-\\nduce playing styles profiling into their analysis framework when\\nidentifying individual players that they wish to integrate into the\\n515 team. Finally, previous research provided contradictory evidence\\nwhen measuring performance indicators associated with success\\nin isolation of factors (i.e., style of play, home advantage, type of\\ncompetition, quality of opponents and quality of team) that\\nmight affect the value. Therefore, differences in performance\\n520 indicators might be a factor of their playing styles. Researchers\\nshould be aware of these different styles and may integrate this\\ninto their analysis. Limitations of this study should be noted.\\nContextual variables (e.g. ,playing home/away, opposition level)', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\pdf13.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='were not measured and these variables could affect styles of play\\n525 used by teams. These variables could also explain the missed\\npercentage of the variance. Moreover, interaction process should\\nbe considered for a more accurate analysis of styles of play as\\nopponent ’s tactics can also influence the style of play employed\\nby a team. This study provides an introduction to analysing\\n530 playing styles. More variables and matches should be considered\\nto supply conclusive definitions for playing styles and generali-\\nsability of the data.
